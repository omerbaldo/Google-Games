# Google-Games
Code written for competition at google games

Was invited to participate in Google Games in New York City Spring 2015. This problem deals with a stock man having to convert stock letters
to phone letters, and then seeing if the stocks were unique. To complete this, I created an int to contain the sum of all these numbers.
This unique sum was given a position in a hash map and a value for true or false (true if unique or false if not). Was able to pass all
3271 test cases.
